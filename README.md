## Project Summary:
Designed and developed a comprehensive dental website leveraging AOS, React, and Bootstrap technologies. The website allows users to conveniently book appointments online and access essential information about the dental office. Additionally, the platform provides a wealth of patient resources, offering valuable dental health information. The project showcases proficiency in front-end web development, JavaScript, and React, while adhering to clean code practices to ensure scalability and maintainability.

## Key Features:
* **Online Appointment Booking:** Implemented a user-friendly interface that enables visitors to schedule dental appointments conveniently online.

* **Dental Office Information:** Provided essential details about the dental office, including location, contact information, and services offered, fostering a transparent and informative experience for users.
  
* **Patient Resources:** Developed a repository of patient resources containing valuable dental health information, educating users on various dental topics and promoting oral hygiene awareness.
  
* **AOS Integration:** Utilized AOS (Animate On Scroll) to introduce subtle and engaging animations, enhancing the website's visual appeal and user engagement.
  
* **Responsive Design:** Employed Bootstrap to ensure the website is responsive and optimally displayed across different devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
  
* **Clean React Code:** Employed JSX shorthands, components, and hooks to write clean and modular React code, simplifying maintenance and codebase management.
  
* **Limited JavaScript in JSX Files:** Ensured a separation of concerns by minimizing JavaScript code within JSX files, enhancing code readability and maintainability.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
